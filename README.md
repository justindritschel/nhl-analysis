# nhl-analysis
Some basic exploratory NHL Data Analysis
When using the scraper, the dates can be changed in the nhl_url line of code nested in the for loop. This scraper will gather data on each individual game of the NHL season thus far (that is, each game has 2 rows, one for each team that played in the game). The scraper can be used as is create a csv with every game played in the 2023-2024 NHL Season to date, and will continue to work for the remainder of the season as such. A sample of some simple data analysis is provided in R.
